                <p class="article-body">
                    <h2>I am in the early moments of my learning journey.</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>I absolutely love researching</strong>, I’m a bit obsessed and will travel down many a path to search and vet out resource
                    after resource. At times this has been to my detriment, feeling like I was barely keeping my chin above water,
                    trying to stay afloat in a huge ocean of information. But <strong>when something made sense to me, I stuck with it</strong>. I paid attention
                    to myself and what inspired me and set a course with an end in mind to keep pushing forward.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I currently study roughly 1 hour
                    weeknights after work, and 3-5 each weekend day. Give or take - busy mama right here ;)
                </p>

                <p>
                    As I’ve filtered through my resources, <strong>I have pushed on through confusion</strong>, and sometimes stopped completely to
                    move on to a different resource. I once signed up and paid for a “bootcamp” with great reviews on <a class="link-resources" target="_blank"
                                                                                                                         href="https://www.coursereport.com/">Course Report</a>, only to be so disappointed with it that
                    I thankfully dropped and got a full refund.  I’ve even created actual projects <strong> (like this blog!!)</strong>.
                </p>

                <h4>Along the way,  I’ve realized my goal:</h4>

                <p>
                    I want to learn pure html and css, best practices and in-depth, with the aim to<strong> create clean and effective work</strong>. Then
                    I'll start digging into vanilla Javascript, then potentially Python  - I've read great things about the community around this language.
                </p>

                <h4>As I progress my goals may change...</h4>
                <p>
                    But I feel stoked to be at a place where I can <strong>adapt when the river bends</strong> and make a new plan that suits the new hopes and skills I’m stoking on.
                    I have dabbled in Wordpress and Bootstrap, but I’ve decided to <strong>seek a deeper understanding of the fundamentals</strong> before moving on to
                    frameworks, or CMS's and such.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I encourage you to use this as your springboard to discover what you like and want to learn, not as a set path. We all have our own way, learn so differently,
                    and have different things that appeal to us. <strong>Pay attention to and follow the things that light you up</strong>, that spark ideas in your mind and spur
                    you on to keep studying and growing!
                </p>

                <h4>And with that in mind, this is my list of current resources:</h4>


                <h5>
                    <a class="resourcelist-link" target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn">
                        Mozilla Developer Network(MDN) Learning
                    </a>
                </h5>
                <p resourcelist-body>
                    skills: html, css, javascript<br>
                    This is a fabulous place you can return to again and again. Read the documents and also throw the letters "mdn"
                    after your google searches and you can trust the advice you find there will be solid.
                </p>

                <p resourcelist-body>
                    skills: html, css<br>
                    <strong>This is the resource from which this blog was created</strong>. Again, Kevin Powell is the best at css
                    that I've found. I'm not a big fan of the code-along platforms so I follow along in <a class="link-resources"target="_blank" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/VS"> VS code</a>
                    to more accurately replicate a realistic dev environment. That being said, of the in-screen learn code platforms, I do prefer the way Scrimba is set up to say, codeacademy or fcc.
                    I am about halfway through this course, and I am loving it and feel like css is becoming clearer and clearer. Thank you Kevin!
                </p>

                <p resourcelist-body>
                    skills: html, css<br>
                    An awesome, knowledge-based focus on CSS fundamentals atop a solid HTML base with no framework to obscure.

                <p resourcelist-body>
                    skills: html, css, javascript<br>
                    Free Code Camp is an awesome and free resource. I've only worked up to the CSS section, but it was really helpful
                    at the beginning for me to gain confidence and familiarity with syntax. They also have a forum, and their blog has tons
                    of helpful info and motivation from people who've earned the many certificates offered, and credit fcc for their success at becoming self-taught web devs.
                </p>

                <h5>
                    <a class="resourcelist-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">
                        Colt Steele's Web Dev Bootcamp on Udemy
                    </a>
                </h5>
                <p resourcelist-body>
                    skills: html, css, dev environment, research, etc<br>
                    This was the first course I took after a few weeks of random study and researching all things web dev. I really
                    loved the instructor’s style and learned so much. But! this course is very outdated. It was originally created in 2015 and much of
                    the material will have glitches which a teaching assistant will explain or you can research to find a workaround. Though it will get
                    you up and coding in a realistic environment if you have the patience to get through the glitchy parts. And the instructor is IMO awesome,
                    silly and very engaging. I wish he'd make a 2020 version of this course! I will also warn you that I followed along and was clear on what I was learning the
                    entire first 36% of the course -then he got to JavaScript and I felt utterly lost and thrown in with little foundational knowledge
                    shared. And so, there I stopped and moved on to research more resources and change my plan. Also,
                    regarding any Udemy course: Do not pay full price, it should cost no more than $12, email Udemy if you don’t see a discount applied.

                    Search up Web development success stories and poke around - but try to not get overwhelmed! There are many fun rabbit holes to get lost down here -
                    and some really phenomenal writing to distract you from your path.

                    If you think you’re too old, too young, not smart enough, or not tech-inclined, this course will give you
                    a perspective shift and tools to learn whatever you like. I finished it in weeks with minimal time commitment - very worth it! Coursera has
                    many other interesting and free courses specific to web development.

                    This is the resource I used to make the first version of this blog, via Wordpress. After much consideration,
                    I decided to devote more study time to HTML and CSS and to put Wordpress learning aside for a bit...maybe forever
                    we will see! Based on that, I didn't finish this one, but Traversy Media is great. He offers a wealth of helpful
                    tutorials on YouTube and Udemy in so many different dev subjects.
                </p>

                    Perhaps you'll craft your own syllabus and path- and not tread water for ages as I did!
                    My list of intended javascript and <a class="link-resources" href="resourcelist.html">other resources</a> includes what I plan to study, but since I
                    have not taken those tutorials, I offer that list to you with the caveat that I cannot speak to their effectiveness quite yet.

                    Good luck on your search! I hope your learning journey is <strong>filled with so many triumphs</strong>. But remember, the tough bits
